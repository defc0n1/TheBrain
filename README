Repository for TheBrain project.

Copyright 2014, ≈Åukasz Gandecki

I put the code on the public github repository so everyone can look around and see how a mature Meteor project might be constructed and organized. 
I use a lot of advanced Meteor features that are not covered in the meteor.com examples.
Feel free to use it for learning purposes, fork, play around, but please DO NOT start up a project like mine using my code.

If you want to contribute or invest - great! Email me at lgandecki@thebrain.pro . 

PR more than welcome!
